      <h1>TAVI Heart Team App Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <h2>Last updated: 14 May 2021</h2>

      <div class="row align-items-start">
        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p class="lead">TAVI Heart Team App has been built as a commercial application. This SERVICE is provided by
          William Redwood, Dr Christopher Allen, and other associated research fellows (collectively "the developers"),
          and is intended for
          use as-is. Hereafter, the developers may also be referred to as “We”, “Us”, "Our", "Me", "I".</p>
        <p class="lead">Hereafter, TAVI Heart Team App may also be referred to as "this application" or "the
          application".</p>
        <hr>

        <p class="info">By downloading or using this application, these Terms & Conditions will automatically apply to
          you - therefore, you should ensure to read them carefully before using the application.</p>

        <p class="info">The user may not copy or modify the app, or any part of the app or any associated trademarks, in
          any way. The user must not attempt to extract the source code of the app, or translate the app into other
          languages, or make
          derivative versions. The app itself, and any associated trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
          intellectual property rights related to it belong to the developers.</p>

        <p class="info">The developers are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
          For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
          and for any reason. We
          will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
          paying for. The developers have endeavoured to present the information in this application in a form which is
          as complete and
          accurate as possible, but do not warrant or represent either that it is complete or accurate.</p>

        <p class="info">With respect to the developers' responsibility for a user's use of the application, when the
          application is in use it is important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated
          and correct at all
          times, we do rely on third-parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. The
          developers accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, a user may experience as a result of relying
          wholly on the
          functionality of the application. The user hereby indemnifies the authors, developers, and publishers of the
          app against any and all loss and damages (including, but not limited to; consequential, direct, indirect,
          special, punitive or
          incidental damages and damages or losses of any other kind) howsoever arising from any cause whatsoever
          arising out of or relation to the use of this application or the information contained therein. The
          information and content contained
          in this application, including text, diagrams. and illustrations, is to be used for educational purposes only
          and is not a substitute for sound clinical judgment or professional advice.</p>

        <p class="info">Although all advertising material contained within the application is expected to conform to
          expected ethical and medical standards, inclusion does not represent a guarantee or endorsement of the
          publisher of either the
          quality or value of such a product or of the claim made by the manufacturer.</p>

        <p class="info">Any statements made about commercial products are solely the opinion of the authors and do not
          constitute an endorsement or evaluation of these products. These statements should not be used in advertising
          or for any
          commercial purpose.</p>

        <p class="info">At some point, we may wish to release updates for the application. The application is currently
          available on iOS and macOS - the requirements for these systems, and any additional systems we may decide to
          extend the
          availablity of the application to, may change, and the user will need to download any applicable updates
          should they wish to continue using the application. The developers do not promise to always update the
          application so that it is
          relevant to the user and/or works with the user's specific device.
          We may also wish to stop providing the application, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
          notice of termination to the user. Unless we tell the user otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
          licenses granted to
          the user in these terms will end; (b) the user must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from their
          device.</p>

        <p class="info">The developers do not take responsibility for the application not working at full functionality
          should the user not have an active internet connection. If using the application in an area outside of Wi-Fi
          coverage, the user
          should remember that their terms of agreement with their mobile network provider will still apply. As a
          result, the user may be charged by their mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the
          application, or other third-party charges. In using the application, the user is accepting responsibility for
          any such charges, including roaming data charges if they were use the app outside of their home territory
          (i.e. region or
          country) without turning off data roaming. If the user is not the bill payer for the device on which they are
          using the app, please be aware that we assume that the user has received permission from the bill payer for
          using the
          application.</p>

        <p class="info">The developers cannot always take responsibility for the way the user uses the application. For
          example, it is the user's responsibility to ensure their device remains charged - if it runs out of battery
          and they cannot turn
          it on to avail the Service, the developers cannot accept responsibility.</p>

        <p class="info">The application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to
          provide the service. It is the user's responsibility to keep their phone and access to the application secure.
          We therefore
          recommend against users jailbreaking or otherwise modifying their devices, which, as a process, involves
          removing software restrictions/limitations imposed by the official operating system of their device. The
          developers do not guarantee
          that, should the user jailbreak or otherwise modify their device, the application would continue to work as
          expected.</p>

        <p class="info">The application also uses third-party services that declare their own Terms & Conditions, and
          these may be found here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms">https://firebase.google.com/terms</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Changes to these Terms</h3>
        <p class="info">We may update our Terms & Conditions from time to time. Thus, users are advised to review this
          page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms & Conditions on
          this page.</p>
