      <h1>TAVI Heart Team App Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Last updated: 14 May 2021</h2>
      <br>
      <div class="row align-items-start">
        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="lead">TAVI Heart Team App has been built as a commercial application. This SERVICE is provided by
          William Redwood, Dr Christopher Allen, and other associated research fellows (collectively "the developers"),
          and is intended for
          use as-is. Hereafter, the developers may also be referred to as “We”, “Us”, "Our", "Me", "I".</p>
        <p class="lead">This page is used to inform visitors regarding the policies with the collection, use, and
          disclosure of personal information for those who decide to use this service.</p>
        <p class="lead">If you choose to use this service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
          relation to this Privacy Policy. The personal information collected is used for providing and improving the
          service. Information
          will not be used or shared with anyone, except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p class="lead">The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in the Terms & Conditions.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p class="info">For a better experience while using the service, users may be required to provide certain
          personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, their full name, email address,
          profession, institution, and
          country of work.</p>
        <p class="info">Certain third-party services are also used, and they may collect information used to identify
          users. Their respective Privacy Policies may be found here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>nAnonymised Research Data</h3>
        <p class="info">The application may also collect anonymised patient records should a user not opt-out (or
          opt-in) through the in-app settings after this onboarding process (About tab -> User profile). This would be
          collected for the
          purposes outlined below.</p>
        <p class="info">These will have the Patient ID randomised, and any ECG scan images removed, to reduce the chance
          of any records being recognised.</p>
        <p class="info">The collected data would be used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To correlate patient and device selection with real-world outcomes.</li>
          <li>To enable the identification and testing of novel risk variables or scores, to help improve the evaluation
            of patients undergoing consideration for TAVI/valve intervention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="info">Any information which is collected during the course of this research will be kept strictly
          confidential. The information we analyse for the results will be anonymous. The information will be kept for
          up to twelve months
          after the research has been completed, before being destroyed. Any data will be kept securely, as outlined in
          the "Security" section of this policy below. These steps mitigate any potential risks to user who opt-in.</p>
        <p class="info">If you opt-in to anonymised patient record collection, but later opt-out, the developers are not
          automatically notified. No further records are collected by the developers, but any previously-collected
          records may not be
          deleted. Should a user desire that previously-collected records are deleted, please contact us using the
          details at the bottom of this page.</p>
        <p class="info">Likewise, should a user have any questions regarding this, please feel free to contact us using
          the details at the bottom of this page.</p>

        <h3>Usage/Log Data</h3>
        <p class="info">The standard collected data may be used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide and maintain the service, including to monitor usage of the service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retention of collected data</h3>
        <p class="info">Data will be retained only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy
          Policy. Personal data will be retained and used to the extent necessary to comply with legal obligations (such
          as if retention
          is required to comply with applicable laws), to resolve disputes, and to enforce our legal agreements and
          policies.</p>
        <p class="info">Usage/log data will also be retained for internal analysis purposes. This data is generally
          retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is required to strengthen the security or improve
          the functionality of
          the service, or if there is a legal obligation to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p class="info">All information is transmitted and stored using Firebase services, which have all, at the very
          least, successfully completed the ISO 27001 and SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 evaluation process.</p>
        <p class="info">This data may then be processed at our respective operating offices and in any other places
          where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means that this information may be transferred
          to, and maintained on,
          computers located outside of your state, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection
          laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy, followed by your usage
          of the application and
          subsequent submission of any information, represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
        <p class="info">We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that user's data is treated securely and
          in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and that no transfer of user's data will take place to an organisation
          or a country
          unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of user's data and other personal
          information.</p>

        <h3>Links to other sites</h3>
        <p class="info">This service may contain links to other websites. If a user clicks on a third-party link, they
          will be directed to that site. These sites, unless specified otherwise, are not operated by William Redwood or
          their associates.
          It is therefore the user's responsibility to review the Privacy Policy of these websites, as we have no
          control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party
          sites or services.</p>

        <h3>Children's privacy</h3>
        <p class="info">These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
          identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case that we discover that a child under
          13 has provided
          us with personal information, this will be immediately deleted this from our servers. If you are a parent or
          guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so
          that this can be
          actioned accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Data subject rights</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The right to be informed; meaning anyone processing your personal data must make clear what they are
            processing, why, and who else the data may be passed to.</li>
          <li>The right of access; this is your right to see what data is held about you by a Data Controller.</li>
          <li>The right to rectification; the right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect
            in some way.</li>
          <li>The right to erasure; under certain circumstances you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. This
            is also called ‘the Right to be Forgotten’. This would apply if the personal data is no longer required for
            the purposes it
            was
            collected for, or your consent for the processing of that data has been withdrawn, or the personal data has
            been unlawfully processed.</li>
          <li>The right to restrict processing; this gives the Data Subject the right to ask for a temporary halt to
            processing of personal data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has to be concluded, or the
            data is being
            corrected.</li>
          <li>The right to data portability; a Data Subject has the right to ask for any data supplied directly to the
            Data Controller by him or her, to be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
          </li>
          <li>The right to object; the Data Subject has the right to object to further processing of their data which is
            inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected, including profiling, automation, and
            direct marketing.
          </li>
          <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling; Data Subjects have the right not to be
            subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="info">If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of
          these rights, please contact us as noted below.</p>

          periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
          page.</p>
